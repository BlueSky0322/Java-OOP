COVID-19 Vaccine Registration System
--------------------
  Vaccines are one of the methods for us to curb the pandemic and one of the best ways to
protect our society from COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, various efforts
have been carried out globally to develop COVID-19 vaccines. The Special committee for
ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccine supply was established to ensure timely access to the
supply of COVID-19 vaccines for the country. As such, you are commissioned to develop a
window system that simulates the process of accessing to the supply of COVID-19 vaccine
involving real-word objects such as personnel members, people, vaccines, appointments and
vaccination centres, to name a few. The people either citizens or non-citizens should be able
to register for vaccination to the system. Also, the system should allocate the access to
vaccines for people via appointment. In addition, the system should be GUI-driven with
options for the functional scenarios. As an object-oriented programming student, you are
required to identify the domain objects and the relationships and develop the necessary data
attributes or methods needed to fulfil the requirements.
